Universal front-end React + GraphQL starter kit, written in Typescript.

https://reactql.org

## Features

### Front-end stack

- [React v16.8](https://facebook.github.io/react/) (the one with [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)!) for UI.
- [Apollo Client 2.5 (React)](http://dev.apollodata.com/react/) for connecting to GraphQL.
- [MobX-React-Lite](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-react-lite) for declarative, type-safe flux/store state management.
- [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/) CSS-in-JS, with inline `<style>` tag generation that contains only the CSS that needs to be rendered.
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), [Less](http://lesscss.org/) and [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) when importing `.css/.scss/.less` files.
- [React Router 4](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) for declarative browser + server routes.
- [GraphQL Code Generator v1.1](https://graphql-code-generator.com/) for parsing remote GraphQL server schemas, for automatically building fully-typed Apollo React HOCs instead of writing `<Query>` / `<Mutation>` queries manually
- Declarative/dynamic `<head>` section, using [react-helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet).

### Server-side rendering

- Built-in [Koa 2](http://koajs.com/) web server, with async/await routing.
- Full route-aware server-side rendering (SSR) of initial HTML.
- Universal building - both browser + Node.js web server compile down to static files, for fast server re-spawning.
- Per-request GraphQL store. Store state is dehydrated via SSR, and rehydrated automatically on the client.
- MobX for app-wide flux/store state, for automatically re-rendering any React component that 'listens' to state. Fully typed state!
- Full page React via built-in SSR component - every byte of your HTML is React.
- SSR in both development and production, even with hot-code reload.

### Real-time

- Hot code reloading; zero refresh, real-time updates in development.
- Development web server that automatically sends patches on code changes, and restarts the built-in Web server for SSR renders that reflect what you'd see in production.
- WebSocket `subscription` query support for real-time data (just set `WS_SUBSCRIPTIONS=1` in [.env](.env))

### Code optimisation

- [Webpack v4](https://webpack.js.org/), with [tree shaking](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/) -- dead code paths are automatically eliminated.
- Asynchronous code loading when `import()`'ing inside a function.
- Automatic per-vendor chunk splitting/hashing, for aggressive caching (especially good behind a HTTP/2 proxy!)
- Gzip/Brotli minification of static assets.
- CSS code is combined, minified and optimised automatically - even if you use SASS, LESS and CSS together!

### Styles

- [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/), for writing CSS styles inline and generating the minimal CSS required to properly render your components.
- [PostCSS v7](http://postcss.org/) with [next-gen CSS](https://preset-env.cssdb.org/) and automatic vendor prefixing when importing `.css`, `.scss` or `.less` files.
- [SASS](http://sass-lang.com) and [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) support (also parsed through PostCSS.)
- Automatic vendor prefixing - write modern CSS, and let the compiler take care of browser compatibility.
- Mix and match SASS, LESS and regular CSS - without conflicts!
- CSS modules - your classes are hashed automatically, to avoid namespace conflicts.
- Compatible with Foundation, Bootstrap, Material UI and more. Simply configure via a `.global.(css|scss|less)` import to preserve class names.

### Production-ready

- Production bundling via `npm run production`, that generates optimised server and client code.
- [Static compression](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/compression-webpack-plugin/) using the Gzip and [Brotli](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2015/09/introducing-brotli-new-compression.html) algorithms for the serving of static assets as pre-compressed `.gz` and `.br` files (your entire app's `main.js.bz` - including all dependencies - goes from 346kb -> 89kb!)
- Static bundling via `npm run build:static`. Don't need server-side rendering? No problem. Easily deploy a client-only SPA to any static web host (Netlify, etc.)

### Developer support

- Written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) with full type support, out the box (all external `@types/*` packages installed)
- Heavily documented code

## Quick start

Grab and unpack the latest version, install all dependencies, and start a server:

```
wget -qO- https://github.com/leebenson/reactql/archive/4.5.1.tar.gz | tar xvz
cd reactql-4.5.1
npm i
npm start
```

Your development server is now running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Building GraphQL HOCs

By default, your GraphQL schema lives in [schema/schema.graphql](schema/schema.graphql)

To create fully Typescript-typed Apollo React HOCs based on your schema, simply put the query in a `.graphql` anywhere inside the source folder, and run:

```
npm run gen:graphql
```

You can then import the query like we do in the [HackerNews demo component](src/components/example/hackernews.tsx):

```ts
// Query to get top stories from HackerNews
import { GetHackerNewsTopStoriesComponent } from "@/graphql";
```

And use it as follows:

```ts
<GetHackerNewsTopStoriesComponent>
    {({ data, loading, error }) => (...)}
</GetHackerNewsTopStoriesComponent>
```

To get access to the underlying `gql`-templated query (in case you need it for refetching, etc), in this case it'd be `GetHackerNewsTopStoriesDocument`.

See [GraphQL Code Generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com/) for more details on how it works.

You can also edit [codegen.yml](codegen.yml) in the root to point to a remote schema, or change the file location.

## Development mode

Development mode offers a few useful features:

- Hot code reloading. Make a change anywhere in your code base (outside of the Webpack config), and changes will be pushed down the browser automatically - without page reloads. This happens for React, Emotion, SASS - pretty much anything.

- Full source maps for Javascript and CSS.

- Full server-side rendering, with automatic Koa web server restarting on code changes. This ensures the initial HTML render will always reflect your latest code changes.

To get started, simply run:

```
npm start
```

A server will be started on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Production mode

In production mode, the following happens:

- All assets are optimised and minified. Javascript, CSS, images, are all compiled down to static files that will appear in `dist`.

- Assets are also compressed into `.gz` (Gzip) and `.br` (Brotli) versions, which are served automatically to all capable browsers.

- If files have been generated in a previous run, they will be re-used on subsequent runs. This ensures really fast server start-up times after the initial build.

To build and run for production, use:

```
npm run production
```

Files will be generated in `./dist`, and a server will also be spawned at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Clean the cached production build with `npm run clean`, or run `npm run clean-production` to both clean and re-run the production build, as needed.

# Build mode

If you only want to build assets and not actually run the server, use:

```
npm run build:production
```

This is used in the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile), for example, to pre-compile assets and ensure faster start-up times when spawning a new container.

# Static bundling for client-only SPAs

If you're targeting a client-only SPA and hosting statically, you probably don't want to run a Koa web server to handle HTTP requests and render React.

Instead, you can use _**static mode**_, which produces the client-side JS, CSS and assets files, along with an `index.html` for minimal bootstrapping, and dumps them in `dist/public`.

You can then upload the contents of that folder wherever you like - et voila, you'll have a working client-side Single Page App!

There are two static modes available -- for dev and production:

### Development (hot-code reload)

Just like the full-stack version, dev mode gives you hot code reloading, so changes to your local files will be pushed to the browser.

To activate static dev mode, just run:

```
npm run dev:static
```

Your client-side SPA will be online at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), just like normal.

### Production (static deployment)

To build your client-side files ready for production deployment, run:

```
npm run build:static
```

You'll get everything in that 'regular' building provides you with plus a `index.html` to bootstrap your JS, just without the server parts.

### Modifying the `index.html` template

If you want to make changes to the `index.html` file that's used for static bundling, edit [src/views/static.html](src/views/static.html)

## NPM commands

Here's a list of all the NPM script commands available out-the-box:

| Command                    | What it does                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `npm run build:production` | Builds production-ready client/server bundles, but _doesn't_ start a server.                                                                                 |
| `npm run build:static`     | Builds production-ready client bundle and `index.html`; ignores server bundling.                                                                             |
| `npm run clean`            | Removes the `dist` folder, and any previously built client/server bundle.                                                                                    |
| `npm run dev`              | Runs a univeral dev server in memory; auto restarts on code changes _and_ uses hot-code reload in the browser. Does _not_ output anything to `dist`.         |
| `npm run dev:static`       | Runs a client-only dev server using [src/views/static.html] as the template; full hot-code reload. Also doesn't output anything to `dist`.                   |
| `npm run production`       | Builds _and_ runs a production-ready client/server bundle. If previously built, will re-use cached files automatically (run `npm run clean` to clear cache.) |
| `npm run production:clean` | Same as above, but cleans `dist` first to ensure a fresh re-build.                                                                                           |
| `npm start`                | Shortcut for `npm run dev`.                                                                                                                                  |

## Project layout

The important stuff is in [src](src).

Here's a quick run-through of each sub-folder and what you'll find in it:

- [src/components](src/components) - React components. Follow the import flow at [root.tsx](src/components/root.tsx) to figure out the component render chain and routing. I've included an [example](src/components/example) component that shows off some Apollo GraphQL and MobX features, including incrementing a local counter and pulling top news stories from Hacker News (a live GraphQL server endpoint.)

- [src/entry](src/entry) - The client and server entry points, which call on [src/components/root.tsx](src/components/root.tsx) to isomorphically render the React chain in both environments.

- [src/global](src/global) - A good place for anything that's used through your entire app, like global styles. I've started you off with a [styles.ts](src/global/styles.ts) that sets globally inlined Emotion CSS, as well as pulls in a global `.scss` file -- to show you how both types of CSS work.

- [src/lib](src/lib) - Internal libraries/helpers. There's an [apollo.ts](src/lib/apollo.ts) which builds a universal Apollo Client. Plus, Koa middleware to handle hot-code reloading in development and some other Webpack helpers.

- [src/queries](src/queries) - Your GraphQL queries. There's just one by default - for pulling the top stories from Hacker News to display in the example component.

- [src/runner](src/runner) - Development and production runners that spawn the Webpack build process in each environment.

- [src/views](src/views) - View components that fall outside of the usual React component chain, for use on the server. In here, [ssr.tsx](src/views/ssr.tsx) takes care of rendering the root HTML that's sent down the wire to the client. Note this is also a React component - your whole app will render as React! - and [static.html](src/views/static.html) serves as a template for rendering a client-side SPA. Update it as needed.

- [src/webpack](src/webpack) - The Webpack 4 configuration files that do the heavy lifting to transform our Typescript code, images and CSS into optimised and minified assets that wind up in the `dist` folder at the root. Handles both the client and server environments.

You'll also find some other useful goodies in the [root]()...

- [.env](.env) - Change your `GRAPHQL` server endpoint, `WS_SUBSCRIPTIONS=1` for built-in WebSocket support, `HOST` if you want to bind the server to something other than localhost, and `LOCAL_STORAGE_KEY` to set the root key for saving MobX state locally in the client for automatic re-loading in a later session.

- [.nvmrc](.nvmrc) - Specify your preferred Node.js version, for use with NVM and used by many continuous deployment tools. Defaults to v12.2.0

- [codegen.yml](codegen.yml) - Settings for [GraphQL Code Generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com/) (which you can run with `npm run gen:graphql` to generate types/HOCs based on your GraphQL queries/mutations.)

- [netlify.toml](netlify.toml) - Build instructions for fast [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) deployments. **Tip: To quickly deploy a demo ReactQL app, [click here](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/leebenson/reactql).**

- [types](types) - Some basic types that allow you to import fonts, images, CSS/SASS/LESS files, and allow use of the global `SERVER` boolean and `GRAPHQL` endpoint data in your IDE.

- Typescript configuration via [tsconfig.json](tsconfig.json)

- A sample multi-build [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) based on Node 11.8 and Alpine, for quickly deploying your code base to production.
